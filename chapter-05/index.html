    <h1>5 &nbsp; Modeling with meshes</h1>
    <hr>    
   
    <p>In the last chapter, we introduced a way to represent simple geometric concepts such as points, vectors, lines, and circles with numbers. In this chapters, we will discuss how these simple geometric concepts can be combined to build more complex shapes that can be used to build scenes in computer graphics applications.</p>

    <p>We note first that there are many ways to represent shapes with numbers, but we shall focus one particular method: modeling with triangle meshes. This is the method used by the graphics pipeline, the rendering algorithm implemented in modern GPUs. We choose the method because this book is mainly about teaching you how use OpenGL, a software library that control GPUs to draw 3D shapes in real time.</p>

    <p>To drop a few names, other methods include point clouds, splines, distance fields, and volumetric data. We will not be covering them in this book, but curious readers can consult other computer graphics textbooks to learn more about them.</p>

    <h2>5.1 &nbsp; Vertices</h2>

    <p>The graphics pipeline is designed to render three types of simple geometric concepts: points, line segments, and triangles. More complex shapes such as circles, ellipses, chairs, human figures, and so on must be built from these objects in order to be rendered by the graphics pipeline.</p>

    <p>The three geometric concepts have one thing in common: they can be specified by points.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A point is already a point.</li>
        <li>A line segment can be specified by its two endpoints.</li>
        <li>A triangle can be specified by its three corners, all of which are points.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>In computer graphics, a point used to defined a shape is called a <strong>vertex</strong>. A vertex can have one or more <strong>attributes</strong>, which is a fancy term for data associated with the point. Simply put, a vertex is a point that carries some data with it.</p>

    <p>The most important and mandatory attribute of a vertex is its position in 3D space. We know from the previous chapter that a position can be represented by 3 floating-point numbers.</p>

    <p>Other widely used attributes include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>color,</li>
        <li>normal vector, and</li>
        <li>texture coordinates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We know from Chapter 2 that a color can be represented by three numbers: $R$, $G$, and $B$. We will discuss what a normal vector is later in the chapter, but, since it is a vector in 3D space, it can be represented by their coordinates, which are 3 numbers. Texture coordinates will be discussed in Chapter 17, but they can be represented by 2 numbers most of the time.</p>

    <p>More concretely, we can discuss a vertex in terms of the Javascript language, which we will be programming with. A vertex can be thought of as a Javascript object. Its attributes can be thought of the object's (Javascript) properties. As an example, here is a vertex written in the JSON format.</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">
{
    "position": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    "normal": [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
    "color": [1.0, 0.0, 1.0],
    "texCoord": [0.5, 0.5]
}

</code></pre>

    <h2>5.2 &nbsp; Point clouds</h2>

    <p>We said that complex shapes can be made from simple shapes, and simple shapes can be constructed from vertices. So, a shape to be rendered by a graphics pipeline must be made from a collection of vertices. A collection of related vertices is often called a <strong>point cloud</strong>.</p>

    <figure class="figure">
        TODO: Add picture.
        <br>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 5.1</strong> A point cloud making a torus shape.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Typically, all data of a point cloud is stored in one or more arrays of numbers, where each such array is called a <strong>buffer</strong>. In general, there are two ways to organize vertex data into buffers.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Interleaved buffer.</strong> Use a single buffer to store all vertex attributes together, grouping attributes of the same vertex together.</li>
        <li><strong>Separate buffers.</strong> Put each attribute into its own separate buffer. In this way, a point cloud is a collection of buffers, which can include the <i>position buffer</i>, <i>color buffer</i>, <i>normal buffer</i>, <i>texture coordinate buffer</i>, and so on.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To illustrate the above data layouts, let us consider a small point cloud with 3 vertices, each having a position attribute, and a texture coordinate attribute.</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered" style="border-color: black">
        <tr>
            <td class="bg-light"><strong>Vertex Number</strong></td>
            <td style="background-color: #ffdddd" align="right"><strong>#0</strong></td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddffdd" align="right"><strong>#1</strong></td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddddff" align="right"><strong>#2</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="bg-light"><strong>Position</strong></td>
            <td style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: black" align="right">$(0.0, 0.1, 0.2)$</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddffdd; color: black" align="right">$(1.0, 1.1, 1.2)$</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddddff; color: black" align="right">$(2.0, 2.1, 2.2)$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="bg-light"><strong>Texture coordinate</strong></td>
            <td style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: #de970b" align="right">$(0.50, 0.51)$</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddffdd; color: #de970b" align="right">$(0.60, 0.61)$</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddddff; color: #de970b" align="right">$(0.70, 0.71)$</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>If we were to construct an interleaved buffer of the above point cloud, the buffer look like the following.</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered" style="border-color: black">
        <tr>
            <td style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: black">0.0</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: black">0.1</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: black">0.1</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: #de970b">0.51</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: #de970b">0.52</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddffdd; color: black">1.0</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddffdd; color: black">1.1</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddffdd; color: black">1.1</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddffdd; color: #de970b">0.61</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddffdd; color: #de970b">0.62</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddddff; color: black">2.0</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddddff; color: black">2.1</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddddff; color: black">2.2</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddddff; color: #de970b">0.71</td>
            <td style="background-color: #ddddff; color: #de970b">0.72</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>In the Javascript language, this would be equivalent to specifying the following array.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
const interleavedBuffer = [
    0.0, 0.1, 0.2,  // Vertex #0's position
    0.50, 0.51,     // Vertex #0's texture coordinate 
    1.0, 1.1, 1.2,  // Vertex #1's position
    0.60, 0.61,     // Vertex #1's texture coordinate 
    2.0, 2.1, 2.2,  // Vertex #2's position
    0.70, 0.71      // Vertex #2's texture coordinate 
];

</code></pre>
    
    <p>On the other hand, if we were to create separate buffers for the point cloud. We would have the following two buffers.</p>

    <p><table>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px" align="right"><strong>Position:</strong></td>
            <td>
                <table class="table-bordered" style="border-color: black">
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffdddd; color: black">0.0</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffdddd; color: black">0.1</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffdddd; color: black">0.1</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ddffdd; color: black">1.0</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ddffdd; color: black">1.1</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ddffdd; color: black">1.1</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ddddff; color: black">2.0</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ddddff; color: black">2.1</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ddddff; color: black">2.2</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px" align="right"><strong>Texture coordinate:</strong></td>
            <td>
                <table class="table-bordered" style="border-color: black">
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffdddd; color: #de970b">0.51</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffdddd; color: #de970b">0.52</td>

                    </tr>
                </table>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    
    <p>In the Javascript language, the above is equivalent to the following code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
const positionBuffer = [

    0.70, 0.71      // Vertex #2's texture coordinate 
];

    <h2>5.3 &nbsp; Primitives</h2>

    <p>We said earlier that we may specify shapes by specifying connections between vertices. The shape specified in this way is called a <strong>primitive</strong>.</p>

    <p>Different implementations of the graphics pipeline have different primitives that they support. WebGL, the implementation that we will use, supports the following primitives.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Point.</b> Specified by a single vertex.</li>
        <li><b>Line segment.</b> Specified by two vertices, which serve as its endpoints.</li>
        <li><b>Line strip.</b> Specified by an arbitrary number of vertices in a list. The primitive is a collection of line segments connecting consecutive vertices.</li>
        <li><b>Line loop.</b> Also specified by an arbitrary number of vertices in a list. This primitive is just a line strip primitive with an extra line segment connecting the first and the last vertex together.</li>
        <li><b>Triangle.</b> Specified by three vertices, which serve as its corners.</li>
        <li><b>Traingle strip.</b> Specified by an arbitrary number of vertices in a list. This primitive is a set of connected triangles. The first three vertices from the first triangle. For each new vertex in the list, a new triangle is formed between itself and the two vertices that come before it.</li>
        <li><b>Triangle fan.</b> Specified by an arbitrary number of vertices in a list. Again, this primitive is a collection of connected triangles, and the first triangle is formed from the first three vertices. For each new vertex, a new triangle is formed between itself, the vertex that comes before it, and the first vertex. The primitive can thus be thought of as a "fan" that emanates from the first vertex.</li>
    </ul>

    <figure class="figure">
        TODO: Add picture.
        <br>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 5.2</strong> Primitives supported by WebGL.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>While a primitive may be specified by a collection of vertices, it is in general different from a point cloud because a primitive also includes other points that make up the shape. For example, a line segment is a primitive that can be defined by two vertices, its endpoints. It is different from a point cloud containing those two points because a line segment is also made up of all the points between the two segments. Similarly, a triangle is more than the vertices that make their corners because it contains other points between those vertices. While a point cloud is jus a collection of discrete points with no connections between them, all primitives (except the point primitive) contain a continuous group of points that can from curves and surfaces. It is from these curves and surfaces that we model shapes in scenes.</p>

    <h2>5.4 &nbsp; Meshes</h2>

    <p>In WebGL, shapes are modeled by meshes. A <b>mesh</b> is a point cloud together with information about connections between the vertices in it and also information about the primitives those connections should be interpreted as. A mesh can have many primitives, and in general all the primitives wpuld be of the same type. So, we may have a <b>triangle mesh</b> or a <b>wireframe</b>, which is a mesh of line segments. Meshes of other primitives are possible, but they are not as frequently used as the two we just mentioned.</p>

    <figure class="figure">
        TODO: Add picture.
        <br>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 5.3</strong> A triangle mesh and a wireframe.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>If we were to represent a mesh as a Javascript object, the object would contain three important pieces of data.
    <ol>
        <li>The type of primitives in the mesh.</li>
        <li>A buffer or multiple buffers containing attributes of vertices in the point cloud.</li>
        <li>Another buffer called the <b>index buffers</b> that contains the indices of vertices in the point cloud that should be connected to form primitives.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>5.4.1 &nbsp; An example triangle mesh</h3>

    <p>Below is a mesh representing a $1 \times 1$ square in the $xy$-plane whose lower-left endpoint is the origin $(0,0,0)$.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
const GL_TRIANGLES  = 4;

const mesh = {
    "primitive": GL_TRIANGLES,
    "positions": [
        0.0, 0.0, 0.0,  // Vertex #0's position
        1.0, 0.0, 0.0,  // Vertex #1's position
        1.0, 1.0, 0.0,  // Vertex #2's position
        0.0, 1.0, 0.0   // Vertex #3's position
    ],
    "colors": [
        1.0, 1.0, 1.0,  // Vertex #0's color (white)
        1.0, 1.0, 0.0,  // Vertex #1's color (yellow)
        1.0, 0.0, 1.0,  // Vertex #2's color (magenta)
        0.0, 1.0, 1.0   // Vertex #3's color (cyan)
    ],
    "indices": [
        0, 1, 2,  // Triangle #1
        0, 2, 3   // Triangle #2
    ]
};

</code></pre>

    <figure class="figure">
        TODO: Add picture.
        <br>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 5.3</strong> A triangle mesh.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We see that there are 4 vertices in the mesh. Each vertex has two attributes, its position and color. The vertices are used to form two triangles, and a triangle is represented by 3 indices in the index buffer, resulting in 6 numbers in total. An advantage of this representation is that the data of a vertex can be used multiple times (Vertex 1 and Vertex 2 are used 2 times), saving a lot of space.</p>
