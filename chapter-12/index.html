    <h1>12 &nbsp; Uniform variables</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>In this last chapter, we saw examples on how vertex shaders can be used to render more complex shapes by transforming simple shapes. One thing that should become clear is that a GLSL program can only transform shapes that are passed to them through vertex and index buffers. The data that are to be stored in these buffers are prepared first by the Javascript part of our application, which we shall call the <b>host program</b>. They are then stored in the computer's main memory (i.e., RAM). Then, the host program transfers the data to the buffers, which reside in GPU memory. As a result, communication between the host program and the GLSL program is a crucial part of 3D application development with OpenGL.</p>

    <p>So far, we have been using only one mechanism for communication between a host program and a GLSL program: buffers. Buffers are specialized for communicating vertex and index data, and they have many restrictions. GLSL programs do not have direct access to data inside index buffers. A vertex shader can access data inside vertex buffers, but a fragment shader cannot. However, there are two more such mechanisms: uniform variables and textures. This chapter discuss the former, but the reader would have to wait until Chapter XXX for a discussion of the latter.</p>

    <p>A <b>uniform variable</b> is a piece of GPU memory for storing a small piece of information, which can be directly set by the host program. Unlike buffers, both vertex shaders and fragment shaders have access to uniform variables. Both shaders would see the same value when referencing the same uniform variable, and this is why it is called "uniform." Moreover, the shaders cannot change the value themsevles, so this value would remain constant until the host program rewrites the variable. As a result, uniform variables can serve as "global" variables for GLSL programs.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, we will how to declare and manipulate uniform variables with both GLSL and Javascript. We start with a simple program where uniform variables are used to communicate user inputs to GLSL programs. We will then see how to manipulate uniform variables so that they change with time, and this would allow use to create simple animations. Lastly, we will study uniform variables that have array types, which would allow us to transfer a larger chunk of data to GLSL programs.</p>

    <h2>12.1 &nbsp; Program 1: Basic usage of uniform variables</h2>

    <p>Program 1's source code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/pkhungurn/cg-book-code/tree/main/chapter-12/program-01"><tt>chapter-12/program-01</tt></a> directory of the code repository. Its screenshots are shown in Figure 12.1.</p>

      <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 12.1</strong> Screenshots of Program 1 (a) when it is started afresh (b) when the color sliders are manipulated, and (c) when the "phase," "peroid," and "amplitude" sliders are manipulated.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Program 1 draws a sine curve on its canvas. The curve's color and shape can be control by the 6 sliders in the web page. The first three sliders are used to pick the RGB color of the sine curve. The next three sliders control the phase, period, and amplitude of the curve, respectively.</p>

    <p>Recall that this is not the first time we control what appears on the screen with UI elements. In Program 4 of Chapter 8, we control the color of the canvas through sliders. Moreover, just in the last chapter, we choose what shapes appear in canvases through radio boxes. However, the mechanism used to change the canvas in these programs do not require any information to be passed from the host program to the GLSL shader. In Program 4 of Chapter 8, we use the slider values as arguments to <code>gl.clearColor</code>, a Javascript method. In the last chapters, we use the radio boxes' values to choose which GLSL program to use, and this process is carried out entirely in Javascript. In this chapter, though, we explicitly pass information from UI elements (i.e., the sliders) to the GLSL program, and let the program process the information itself.</p>

    <h3>12.1.1 &nbsp; Declaring and using uniform variables in GLSL</h3>

    <p>As said earlier, the mechanism we use to pass information from host to GLSL in this chapter is the uniform variable. Let's see first hand how they are declared and used in the shaders of our program. We will start with the easier one, the fragment shader, whose source code is reproduced in full below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#version 300 es

precision highp float;

out vec4 fragColor;

uniform vec3 color;

void main() {
    fragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}</code></pre>

    <p>The code above is very similar to those of the fragment shaders in the last chapter. There are two main differences. The first is that there is a new variable called <code>color</code> declared with the <code>uniform</code> keyword.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">uniform vec3 color;</code></pre>

    <p>As you may guess, this is the uniform variable in question. It is just a variable declared with the keyword <code>uniform</code> in front of the data type of the variable. One important thing to note is that a uniform variable <b>must be declared outside any functions</b>. This makes sense because a uniform variable is supposed to be a global variable that should be accessible from any functions. So, its scope should be the entire program, not just inside a particular function. However, remember that a uniform variable is read only, so one should not assign any value to it. In our fragment shader, we use the RGB values stored in the <code>color</code> variable to fill the first 3 components of the output fragment color.</p>

    <p>Next, we look at the vertex shader, which is a little more complicated because it has three uniform variables instead of one.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#version 300 es

const float PI = 3.14159265359;

in float t;

uniform float amplitude;
uniform float period;
uniform float phase;

void main() {
    float x = t;
    float y = amplitude * sin(2.0 * PI * t /period + phase);
    gl_Position = vec4(x, y, 0.0, 1.0);    
}</code></pre>

    <p>We can see creates a sine curve by plotting points $(x,y)$ where
    \begin{align*}
      x &= t, \\
      y &= \mathrm{amplitude} \times \sin\bigg(\frac{2\pi t}{\mathrm{period}} + \mathrm{phase}\bigg).
    \end{align*}
    Here the <code>amplitude</code>, <code>period</code>, and <code>phase</code> variables are uniform variables whose types are <code>float</code>. The names of the variables speak for themselves. The <code>amplitude</code> controls how tall the sine curve is. The <code>period</code> controls with width of one copy of the sine wave. Lastly, the <code>phase</code> controls the horizontal position of where a copy of the sine curve begins.
    </p>

    <h3>12.1.2 &nbsp; Manipulating uniform variables in Javascript</h3>

    <p>It is not enough to modify the GLSL code to declare and use uniform variables. We must change our Javascript code so that it becomes aware of them and assign their values. The code that manipulates uniform variables is in the <a href="https://github.com/pkhungurn/cg-book-code/blob/d06742a0902d97fd738fbc969a2e2c0f077338f3/chapter-12/program-01/src/index.js#L72"><code>updateWebGL</code></a> method in the <a href="https://github.com/pkhungurn/cg-book-code/blob/main/chapter-12/program-01/src/index.js"><code>index.js</code></a> file. Let us start with how to assign a value to the <code>amplitude</code> uniform variable. The first thing we do is to fetch the value to assign from a slider.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">let amplitude = this.amplitudeSlider.slider("value") / 1000.0;</code></pre>

    <p>Here, the <code>amplitudeSlider</code> is a JQuery UI slider that was prepared in the <a href="https://github.com/pkhungurn/cg-book-code/blob/d06742a0902d97fd738fbc969a2e2c0f077338f3/chapter-12/program-01/src/index.js#L21"><code>createUi</code></a> method. How the slider came about is not important as the important thing is that we need a way to figure out what to assign to the uniform variable.</p>

    <p>Before we can assign a value to a uniform variable, we need to use the GLSL program that the uniform variable is a part of. So, next part of the <code>updateWebGL</code> method looks like the following.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">useProgram(this.gl, this.program, () => {
  //
  // Assigning values to uniform variables.
  //

  setupVertexAttribute(
    self.gl, self.program, "t", self.vertexBuffer, 1, 4, 0);
  drawElements(
    self.gl, self.indexBuffer, self.gl.LINES, (self.numVertices-1)*2, 0);
});</code></pre>

    <p>We see that the code uses the <code>useProgram</code> function that we learned about in <a href="../chapter-09/index.html#resource-management">Section 9.4.1</a>. All the manipulation of the uniform variables are done inside the closure that we give the <code>useProgram</code> function as an input. Moreover, notice that the segment that assign uniform variable comes before the last two statements, which draw primitives. This makes sense because uniform variables can affect the shape and appearance of the primitives being drawn, so we must assign them before drawing.</p>

    <p>The segment that assigns values to uniform variables is quite long because we have four variables (<code>rgb</code>, <code>amplitude</code>, <code>period</code>, and <code>phase</code>) to take care of. However, assigning a uniform variable only involves two lines of code. We reproduce the piece of code that assigns the <code>amplitude</code> variable below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">// ******************
// * Using uniforms *
// ******************
// Step 1: Get its location.
let amplitudeLocation = self.gl.getUniformLocation(self.program, "amplitude");
// Step 2: Set its value using the right function.
self.gl.uniform1f(amplitudeLocation, amplitude);
</code></pre>

    <p>Assigning value to a uniform variable involves two steps. The first is to find the "location" of the uniform variable. Here, a location is just a unique identifier that can be used to refer to the variable at a later time. It can be fetched by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/getUniformLocation"><code>getUniformLocation</code></a> method of the WebGL context. The method requires two inputs. The first is the object representing the GLSL program that contains the uniform variable, and the second is the name of the variable as declared in either the vertex and/or fragment shader.</p>

    <p>The second step is to assign the value with a method of the WebGL context whose name is of the form <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/uniform"><code>uniformXXX</code></a> where <code>XXX</code> depends on the type of the uniform variable in question. For non-array types, the rule for the name is quite simple. <code>XXX</code> has two characters.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The first character is either <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, or <code>4</code>, and it indicates how many numbers the data type can store.</li>
      <li>The second character is either <code>i</code> or <code>f</code>, and it indicates the type of each number stored in the data type: <code>i</code> is for integer, and <code>f</code> is for floating point.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a result, the right methods to use for a number of types of uniform variables are as follows.</p>

      <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Table 12.1</strong> Names of the <code>uniformXXX</code> method to be used for certain types of uniform variables.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>In our case, the <code>amplitude</code> uniform variable is of type <code>float</code>, which means the type can only hold one floating point number. Thus, the appropriate method to use is <code>uniform1f</code>. This method takes two arguments. The first is the location of the uniform variable, which we just fetched in the last step, and the second is the floating point value we want to assign.</p>

    <p>Because the <code>period</code> and <code>phase</code> uniform variables are also of type <code>float</code>, we deal with these variables the same way we deal with <code>amplitude</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">let periodLocation = self.gl.getUniformLocation(self.program, "period");
self.gl.uniform1f(periodLocation, period);

let phaseLocation = self.gl.getUniformLocation(self.program, "phase");
self.gl.uniform1f(phaseLocation, phase);
</code></pre>

    <p>We deal with the <code>color</code> uniform variable slightly differently because it is of type <code>vec3</code> instead of <code>float</code>. As <code>vec3</code> stores 3 floating point numbers, the WebGL context method used to assign its value is <code>uniform3f</code> instead of <code>uniform1f</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">let colorLocation = self.gl.getUniformLocation(self.program, "color");
self.gl.uniform3f(colorLocation, color[0], color[1], color[2]);
</code></pre>

    <p>We can see that <code>uniform3f</code> takes 4 parameters instead of 2. The first parameter is still the location of the uniform variable, but 3 floating point values have to be supplied instead of 1. Here, we feed the three values in the <code>color</code> array that was prepared earlier in the <code>updateWebGL</code> function.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">let color = this.rgbSliders.map(s => s.slider("value") / 255);</code></pre>

    <p>This line of code computes the <code>color</code> array by applying the closure that extracts the slider value and divides it by $255$ to the three sliders that correspond to the R, G, and B values that the user can specify.</p>

    <p>There are 6 other methods in Table 12.1 that we have not seen actual usage. However, their usage follows the same rule that applies to <code>uniform1f</code> and <code>uniform3f</code>. The first argument is the location of the uniform variable. The method then takes $N$ extra arguments where $N$ is the number in the method name, and these are arguments are the values to be assigned to the components of the uniform variable.</p>

    <h2>12.2 &nbsp; Program 2: Using a uniform variable to create a moving square</h2>

    <p>In this section, we are going to study another important way to use uniform variables: animation. This principle is simple. We can use Javascript to keep track of how much time have passed since our program started. Then, we can use this information to change how primitives are rendered. This is done by passing the time or other information derived from it to GLSL programs. This section's program renders a square moving in a circular path at a constant angular speed. This source code of the program is available in the <a href="https://github.com/pkhungurn/cg-book-code/tree/main/chapter-12/program-02"><code>chapter-12/program-02</code></a> directory of the book's Github repository. Screenshots of the program are available below.</p>

    </figure>

    <h3>12.2.1 &nbsp; How to keep track of time</h3>

    <p>An animation is an image that moves. This means that it changes with time. Creating animation thus requires us to draw different images at different time. As a r esult, a program that creates an animation must be aware of time. In our case, we need to keep track of how much time has passed since the program begins because the exact time (say, 10:10AM) does not matter.</p>

    <p>We keep track of time through the use of the method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now"><code>performance.now</code> in the host Javascript code.</a> Here, <code>performance</code> is a global variable that comes with the Javascript language. The <code>now</code> method takes no arguments and returns the number of milliseconds since a time which is always before our Javascript program starts. The program has an infinite loop that keeps calling the <code>updateWebGL</code> method in order to repeatedly draw something on the WebGL canvas. As a result, if we call <code>performance.now</code> inside the <code>updateWebGL</code>, we can easily know the time (since the start time) that each interation of the loop is run.</p>

    <p>As stated earlier, we will not use the time directly, but we will keep track of how much time has passed since the program started. To do so, we keep track of the last time the <code>updateWebGL</code> was called. This is stored in the <code>lastTime</code> field of the <code>WebGLApp</code> object that represents our application. We initialize the field in the constructor as follows.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">this.lastTime = performance.now();</code></pre>

    <p>When an instance of <code>WebGLApp</code> is constructed, its <code>updateWebGL</code> method has not been called yet. As a result, we set <code>lastTime</code> field to a time returned from <code>performance.now</code> to get an arbitrary starting point. This point in time is not exactly where the program starts, but it should be pretty close. <p>We use another field called <code>elaspedTime</code> to store the time since the <code>lastTime</code> field was initialized. We initialize the field to $0$.</p>

    <p>Inside the <code>updateWebGL</code> method, we need to update both fields so that <code>elapsedTime</code> has the correct value. The code to do so is as follows.</p>
    
<pre><code class="language-c">let currentTime = performance.now();
let delta = currentTime - this.lastTime;   
this.elaspedTime += delta;
this.lastTime = currentTime;
</code></pre>

    <p>The logic of the above code is quite simple. We call <code>performance.now</code> to get the current time. We then subtract from it the <code>lastTime</code> field to get the number of milliseconds since last time the <code>updateWebGL</code> method was called. We add this value to the <code>elapsedTime</code> field to update its value. Then, we set the <code>lastTime</code> field to the current time so that we can use this value in the next iteration. The <code>elapsedTime</code> field now stores the number of milliseconds since the program starts, and it gets updated every time the <code>updateWebGL</code> method is executed.</p>

    <h3>12.2.3 &nbsp; Time-dependent displacement</h3>

    <p>One of the simplest form of animation is when an object continuously moves withouth changing its shape. The animation Program 2 shows is exactly this: a white square that moves in a circular path. To move is to change position. A <b>displacement</b> is a vector that represents a change in position. It is defined as:
    \begin{align*}
      \mathrm{displacement} = (\mathrm{new\ position}) - (\mathrm{old\ position}).
    \end{align*}
    Now, an object in our context is a mesh. A mesh is a collection of vertices that are connected together. Each vertex has a position, and it is stored in the mesh's vertex buffer. We often think of these positions as the vertices' "rest position" as they are the positions that define the shape of the object when it is not move or deformed. To move an object without changing its shape, we just have to move all vertices by the same displacement. In this way, all the relative distances between the vertices will be preserved. Mathematically, this is done by adding the displacement to the position of each vertex, and this is exactly what is done in the vertex shader of Program 2.
    </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#version 300 es

in vec2 position;

uniform vec2 displacement;

void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(position + displacement, 0, 1);
}</code></pre>

    <p>Much like many GLSL programs have seen before, we use the <code>position</code> attribute variable to store vertex positions. What is new is the <code>displacement</code> uniform variable, which represents the displacement. We can see that what the vertex shader does is to add the displacement to the vertex position and output the result.</p>

    <p>Now that we know how to move an object from its rest position to another position, we now need to figure out how to make the object's position change over time. This is easy: we only need to make the displacement changes over time. So, every time the screen is update, we need to set the <code>displacement</code> uniform variable to a new value. Let's look at the part of the <a href="https://github.com/pkhungurn/cg-book-code/blob/d334f114da0f590cb4c04e200604e45979a0e706/chapter-12/program-02/src/index.js#L45"><code>updateWebGL</code></a> method that does this.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">let angularPosition = 0.001 * this.elaspedTime;
        
let displacementX = 0.5 * Math.cos(angularPosition);
let displacementY = 0.5 * Math.sin(angularPosition);

useProgram(this.gl, this.program, () => {
  let displacementLocation = self.gl.getUniformLocation(
    self.program, "displacement");
  self.gl.uniform2f(
    displacementLocation, displacementX, displacementY);
  
    :
    :
    :
});</code></pre>

    <p>Because we want our square to move in a circular path, the displacement should be vectors from the center of a circle to points on the circumference of the circle. In case of unit circles, the vectors are given by
    \begin{align*}
      \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta \\ \sin \theta \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    where $\theta$ is an angle. As a result, we can our square to move in a circular path by changing the angle over time. This is basically what the Javascript code do in this code line:    
    </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">let angularPosition = 0.001 * this.elaspedTime;</code></pre>

    <p>Here, <code>angularPosition</code> is the variable we use to represent the angle. As discussed in the last section, the field <code>elapsedTime</code> changes every time the <code>updateWebGL</code> method is called. The factor <code>0.001</code> is applied because <code>elapsedTime</code>'s unit is milliseconds, which means that using the value directly would make the square move 1 radian (about one sixth of a circle) per millisecond, which is too fast for our naked eyes to see. From <code>angularPosition</code>, the code computes the $x$- and $y$-componets of the displacement with:
    \begin{align*}
      \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathrm{displacementX} \\ \mathrm{displacementY}
      \end{bmatrix}
      &= \begin{bmatrix}
        0.5 \cos(\mathrm{angularPosition}) \\
        0.5 \sin(\mathrm{angularPosition}) 
      \end{bmatrix}.
    \end{align*}
    The number $0.5$ here is the radius of the circle we want our square to move on. Because the canvas corresponds to the rectangle $[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$, choosing the radius of $0.5$ will make the square's path fit inside the screen.
    </p>

    <p>Lastly, after the $x$- and $y$-components have been computed, we set the uniform variable <code>displacement</code> to these values with <code>glUniform2f</code>.</p>

<pre><code language-c></code>let displacementLocation = self.gl.getUniformLocation(
  self.program, "displacement");
self.gl.uniform2f(
  displacementLocation, displacementX, displacementY);
</pre>

    <h2>12.3 &nbsp; Program 3: Using uniform variables to animate a boucing ball</h2>

    <p>In the last section, we animate a rotating square that does not move, so we will create a more sophisticated animation in this section: one that involves a ball bouncing around the canvas. The source code of the program is availble in the <a href="https://github.com/pkhungurn/cg-book-code/tree/main/chapter-12/program-03"></a><code>chapter-12/program3</code> directory of the book's Github repository. Once you run the program, you will see a white circle moving along straight line paths and changing direction when it hits any one of the side of the screen.</p>

    <h3>12.3.1 &nbsp; Drawing a circle</h3>

    <p>The animation in this section is more advanced that that in the last section because of two reasons. The first is that the movement is more complex: the ball moves and bounces of walls instead of rotating in place. The second is that the shape is more complex: a circle instead of a square. We shall deal with the shape in this section.</p>

    <p>You may recall that we have written a program that draw a circle before in the last chapter. However, we will usea different method here. The idea is to approximate a circle with a collection of triangles. Each triangle has two of its vertices on the circumference of the circle, and the circle's center serves as the third vertex.</p>
