    <h1>6 &nbsp; Normal vectors</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>We learned in the last chapter that we model shapes of objects by modeling their external surfaces. <b>Normal vectors</b> are common properties of surfaces that must be taken to account when creating any surface models.</p>

    <p>We have seen the term "normal vector" before in Section 3.7.5. A normal vector to a plane is a vector that is perpendicular to it. A normal vector to a surface is a vector that is "perpendicular" to that surface in some sense. However, we have to be careful about its definition because a general surface is not completely flat like a plane, and so we cannot conveniently measure the angle between a vector and a surface to decide whether they are perpedicular to each other or not. (There is a way to extend the definition, of course!)</p>

    <p>We care about normal vectors because they tell us about the "directions" of the surface. These directions can be used to perform (1) hidden surface removal (Chapter XXX) and (2) shading (Chapter XXX). Shading is largely about calculating how light interacts with a surface, and this interaction depends on the surface's geometry. The surface's directions, conveyed by normal vectors, are geometric information that plays a central role in lighting calculation.</p>

    <p>Now, the confusing thing about normal vectors, at least in the field of computer graphics, is that there are multiple kinds of them. The normal vector we just talked about is called the <b>surface normal vector.</b> When we model shapes with triangle meshes, we deal with two more types: <b>face normal vector</b> and <b>vertex normal vector.</b> Let us now discuss them in turn.</p>

    <h2>6.1 &nbsp; Surface normal vectors</h2>

    <h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Normal vectors to a flat surface</h3>

    <p>A flat surface is a surface such that there is a 2D plane that contains it. Recall from Section 3.7.5 that a 2D plane in 3D space can be defined by (1) a point on the plane and (2) a vector called the "normal vector." The normal vector has the property that it is perpendicular to the plane, meaning that it is perpendicular to any vectors that is in that plane. Now, if a vector is perpendicalar to a plane, it is also perpendicular to any flat surface contained in that plane. So, we say that a normal vector to the plane is also a normal vector to the flat surface as well.</p>

    <p>Let $\ve{n}$ be a normal vector to a flat surface. We know that it is not the only normal vector because because $2\ve{n}$, $3.14\ve{n}$, $-\ve{n}$, or any $c\ve{n}$ where $c \neq 0$ is also perpendicular to the flat surface.</p>

    <figure class="figure">
        <a href="images/flat-surface-normals.png"><img src="images/flat-surface-normals.png" width="300" alt=""></a>
        <br>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 6.1</strong> A flat surface (represented by the blue rectangle) inside a plane (represented by gray dashed lines) has many normal vectors. Each vector points either upward or downward, but there is no restriction on its length.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>To avoid ambiguity about the length of normal vectors, we often require that normal vectors be unit vectors. In other words, we prefer only to talk about $\ve{n}$ such that $\ve{n} = 1$. With this restriction, we have that a flat surface has two distinct (unit) normal vectors, and they point in the exact opposite direction.</p>

    <figure class="figure">
        <a href="images/flat-surface-unit-normals.png"><img src="images/flat-surface-unit-normals.png" width="300" alt=""></a>
        <br>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 6.2</strong> By restrict ourselves to only consider normals vectors that have unit length, we have that a flat surface has two distinct normal vectors. They point in the exact opposite directions.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Orientation of a flat surface and "the" normal vector</h3>

    <p>The fact that there are two distinct normal vectors to a flat surface corresponds to the fact that surface has two sides. Now, we may choose to call one side the "front" side and the other the "back" side. This choice is arbitrary. After we have picked the side to call "front," we have decided the flat surface's <b>orientation</b>. In effect, we have chosen the way the flat surface is "facing." Picking the side to call "front" is equivalent to pick one of the two normal vectors to serve as "the" (one and only one) normal vector of the surface over the other. <b>In this book, the normal vector is on the front side</b>. In other words, the front side is the side we see when we look in the opposite direction of the normal vector. As a result, <b>the choise of the normal vector reflects the orientation of a flat surface</b>.</p>

    <figure class="figure">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="images/flat-surface-two-sides.png"><img src="images/flat-surface-two-sides.png" alt=""></a></td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td><a href="images/flat-surface-after-normal-picked.png"><img src="images/flat-surface-after-normal-picked.png" alt=""></a></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="center">(a)</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td align="center">(b)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 6.3</strong> (a) We take a side view of the flat surface in Figure 5.9. We see that the surface has two sides, agreeing with the face that it has two distinct (unit) normal vectors. (b) We can pick a side we call the "front" side. This is equivalent to picking one of the two normal vectors to serve as "the" normal vector of the surface. In this book, the normal vector always points away from the front side.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>So, from now on, the normal vector of a flat surface is the unit vetor that:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>is perpendicular to the surface, and</li>
        <li>points away from the side we consider to be the front side.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Let us stress that the normal vector to a flat surface is perpendicular to that surface as a whole. This means that we can place the normal vector anywhere on the surface, and the normal would be perpendicular to the surface at that point.</p>

    <h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; Regular surfaces</h3>

    <p>Curved surfaces such as spheres, tori, ellepsoids are used by artists approximate shapes of 3D objects. These surfaces belong to a class of surfaces called <b>regular surface</b> where the notion of normal vectors are well defined.</p>

    <p>Intuitively, regular surfaces are surfaces that are "locally flat." This means that, when you pick a point on the surface and zoom in on it close enough, the surface in your vision should look flat. Another way to think about this is to imagine the surface to be very big and yourself to be a small creature standing on it. If the surface is a manifold, then it looks like you are standing on a flat plane. In fact, we all have this experience. The earth is round (i.e., its shape can be approximated quite well by a sphere or an ellipsoid), but we can hardly observe its curvature while standing at sea level. It took a long time for humanity to realize that the earth is not flat! (Sadly, some people believe it is even now.)</p>

    <p>We will not, however, define the regular surface mathematically because doing so requires much mathematical machinery that we will not use again in the rest of the book.<sup><a href="#fn:regular-surface-definition">1</a></sup></p>

    <h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; Tangent planes and surface normal vectors</h3>

    <p>A regular surface has a property that allows it to have normal vectors. Each point $P$ of the surface has a plane called the "tangent plane" that "touches" the surface at $P$. For other types of surfaces, the existence of tangent planes are not gauranteed.</p>

    <p>Formally, a <b>secant plane</b> to a surface is a plane that passes through three points of the surface. Let $P$ be a point on a surface $S$. We can force the three points to be closer and closer to $P$. Taking the limit of this process, the secant plane may approach a unique plane that contains $P$. This plane, if it exists, is called the <b>tangent plane at $P$</b>. It is the plane that best approximates the surface around $P$ among all the other planes. For a regular surface, a tangent plane exists for every point. As a result, a regular surface appears locally flat because the surface can be approximated locally by tangent planes.</p>

    <p>We say that a vector $\ve{v}$ is <b>tangent</b> to a surface $S$ at point $P$ if $\ve{v}$ likes in the tangent plane at $P$. We call such a vector $\ve{v}$ a <b>tangent vector</b>.</p>

    <p>We say that a vector $\ve{n}$ is <b>normal</b> to a surface $S$ at point $P$ if the vector is perpendicular to the tangent plane at $P$. Such a vector is called a <b>normal vector</b> or a <b>surface normal vector</b> of $S$.</p>

    <p>If $S$ is a regular surface, then every point on it has a tangent plane and, consequentially, (infinitely many) normal vectors. Following the discussion in Section 6.1.1, we typically require that normal vectors be unit vectors. As a result, each point on $S$ has two normal vectors. One points away from the "front" side of the tangent plane, and the other from the "back" side.</p>

    <h3>6.1.6 &nbsp; Examples</h3>

    <p>Let us consider two simple regular surfaces, the infinite cylinder and the sphere, and determine their tangent planes and normal vectors.</p>

    <h3>6.1.7 &nbsp; Orientation of regular surfaces</h3>
   
    <h2>6.2 &nbsp; Face normal vectors</h2>

    <p>In Section 5.1, we mentioned that the "normal vector" is a common vertex attribute. In order to explain it, however, we need to discuss a related concept of "face normal vectors" (or just "face normals") first.</p>

    <p>While the graphics pipeline can only deal with triangle meshes, other 3DCG software (especiallying modeling software such as <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription">3ds Max</a>, or <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription">Maya</a>) allows meshes where the primitives are general polygons: quadriliterals, pentagons, heptagons, and so on. Each polygon in a mesh is called a <b>face</b>. We will follow this nomenclature and call a triangle in a mesh a face too.</p> 

    
    <h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; The normal vector of a triangle</h3>

    <p>When we specify a triangle, say $ABC$, we need to list its corner points in some order. $A$ thus denotes the first corner, $B$ the second, and $C$ the third.</p>

    <p>
    <div class="bg-light" style="padding: 20px">
        <p>
        <b>Example 6.1</b>
        For example, in the triangle mesh of Section 5.4.1, the $ABC$s of the two triangles are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Triangle #1
                <ul>
                    <li>$A = $ Vertex #0 $= (0,0,0)$.</li>
                    <li>$B = $ Vertex #1 $= (1,0,0)$.</li>
                    <li>$C = $ Vertex #2 $= (1,1,0)$.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Triangle #2
                <ul>
                    <li>$A = $ Vertex #0 $= (0,0,0)$.</li>
                    <li>$B = $ Vertex #2 $= (1,1,0)$.</li>
                    <li>$C = $ Vertex #3 $= (0,1,0)$.</li>
                </ul>            
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>We know from Section 3.7.5 that the vector
    \begin{align*}
    \widetilde{\ve{n}} = (B - A) \times (C - A)
    \end{align*}
    is a vector that is perpendicalar to the triangle. Dividing the vector by its length, we have that
    \begin{align*}
    \widehat{\ve{n}} = \frac{\widetilde{\ve{n}}}{\| \widetilde{\ve{n}} \|} = \frac{(B - A) \times (C - A)}{ \| (B-A) \times (C-A) \|}
    \end{align*}
    is a unit vector that is perpendicular to the triangle. However, we also know that
    \begin{align*}
    -\widehat{\ve{n}} = -\frac{(B - A) \times (C - A)}{ \| (B-A) \times (C-A) \|} = \frac{(C - A) \times (B - A)}{ \| (C-A) \times (B-A) \|}  
    \end{align*}
    is another unit vector that is perpedicular to the triangle. Between $\widehat{n}$ and $-\widehat{n}$, which one we should pick as the normal vector of the triangle then?
    </p>

    <p>In this book, we shall follow the convention is that the normal vector of triangle $ABC$, denoted by $\ve{n}$, is given by
    \begin{align*}
    \ve{n} = \widehat{\ve{n}} = \frac{\widetilde{\ve{n}}}{\| \widetilde{\ve{n}} \|} = \frac{(B - A) \times (C - A)}{ \| (B-A) \times (C-A) \|}.
    \end{align*}
    </p>

        The normal vectors are the same. This is good because these two triangles are used to form a square, another flat surface. The square should have one normal vector rather than two. 
        </p>
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>A consequence of basing the normal vector $\ve{n}$ on $(B-A) \times (C-A)$ rather than other calculation is that <b>one can determine the direction of the normal vector by looking at how the triangle's corners "swirl."</b></p>

    <p>This is the because the direction of $(B - A) \times (C - A)$ is determined by the right-hand rule. Recall from Figure 3.19 that the direction of $(B - A) \times (C - A)$ depends on the rotation to get from $B-A$ to $C-A$. If the rotation is counterclockwise when we look at it, the cross production points towards us. If the rotation is clockwise, then the cross product points away from us.</p>

    <p>Equivalently, we can trace the corners of the triangles in the specified order: from $A$ to $B$ to $C$ and then back to $A$ again. If the we see that the motion is a counterclockwise "swirling," then the triangle's normal vector would point towards us, and we are seeing the front side of the triangle. On the other hand, if the swirling is clockwise, the normal vector points away from us, and we are seeing the back side of the triangle.</p>
